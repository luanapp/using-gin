up: applies the changes in the field "up" in the migration file
down: undo applied changes in the database, using the field "down" in the migration file

The migration file must be a yaml with the following fields:
name: migration name. This is meant for you! Organize your shit, we won't use this field anywhere
description: same as above
up: sql to use when running the migration
down: sql that undo the changes done in the "up" field`,
